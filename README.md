# Course Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data
Coursework for Course#3
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal was to prepare tidy data that could be used for later analysis.   

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

 I had to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository contains:
1. This read.me file, describing everything
2. The run_analysis.R code that completes the assignment
3. The tidy.txt file which is the output for the assignment
4. The codebook describing the variables
